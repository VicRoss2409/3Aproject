# CAD Files

This folder contains the 3D design files for the NEMO underwater robot. All parts were modeled using Fusion 360 and exported in STL format for 3D printing.

The designs include:
- The main structure of the robot
- Motor mounts (horizontal and vertical)
- Internal electronics plate
- Reinforcement bars

Files are organized to make printing, assembly, and future modifications easier.
